# Boomtown Athletics — Website

Static marketing site for **boomtownathletics.com** (Denver/Aurora volleyball —
tournaments, women's/men's/co-ed leagues, training, and nightly drop-in).

_Site version: **v0.22.0** · 2026-07-28_

## Hosting & deploy
- **Origin:** GitHub Pages — repo `10xequity/btvb` (`https://10xequity.github.io/btvb`).
- **Custom domain:** `www.boomtownathletics.com` via `CNAME`, fronted by **Cloudflare** (DNS + CDN/proxy). `www` is canonical.
- **Build step:** none. It is plain HTML/CSS/JS; each page inlines its own CSS/JS.
- **Deploy:** commit to `main`; GitHub Pages publishes automatically. To ship a zip like this one, extract it at the repo root (overwriting the listed files) and commit.
- **URLs use `.html`.** GitHub Pages does **not** auto-rewrite extensionless URLs, so internal links and canonical/OG/JSON-LD self-URLs are written with `.html`. (This corrects an earlier README that described Cloudflare Pages clean-URL behavior — that is not how this site is served.)

## Pages (13)
`index` · `schedule` · `tournaments` · `drop-in` · `womens-league` · `mens-league` ·
`co-ed-leagues` · `training` · `skill-levels` · `contact` · `facility-rules` ·
`queens-club` *(noindex gate → funnels to the women's league)* ·
`library` *(internal image reference — noindex, not linked, not in sitemap)*

`robots.txt` disallows `/queens-club` and `/library`; `sitemap.xml` excludes both.

## Assets
Local images in `/assets/img/` (69 files, ~15.8 MB total — well under GitHub limits).
Partner logos in `/assets/img/partners/`. There is no external image CDN dependency;
all photos are committed to the repo.

## What's new in v0.22.0 (2026-07-28)
- **Meta Pixel is live** (ID `120232615176120623`) on all 11 indexable pages (`queens-club` and `library` excluded).
- **Home carousels** (`About` and `FieldhouseUSA`) converted from CSS-only crossfades to accessible **JS carousels** with glass prev/next controls, keyboard focus, auto-advance that pauses on interaction, and reduced-motion support. Degrades gracefully to the CSS crossfade if JS fails.
- **Tournaments — Formats & Rules** moved above the schedule (with **How to Enter**); scoring rewritten to state **match/side-out scoring as the default**; added two 1-minute time-outs per set, the forfeit rule, the **waiver** requirement, and corrected **Reverse Co-Ed / Co-Ed 4s** rules (10-foot-line jump/attack, below-net-height, hand-set faults).
- **Men's League page overhaul:** removed the "How to qualify" section, added a Men's 4s explainer, a **live schedule table** (Google-Sheet CSV renderer), and a 7-question FAQ with FAQ schema.
- **Women's League:** schedule table now driven by the same **CSV renderer** (6 columns: League · Night · Format · Time · Date · Register).
- **Library page:** added an image **deletion queue** (tick images → copy the generated `git rm` commands) plus likely-duplicate grouping. Persists in the browser via `localStorage`.
- Small moves: **drop-in** House Rules above the FAQ; **skill-levels** "How to choose" above the ladder; removed the **training** Colorado Boom Club placeholder line.
- Sanctioning wording standardized to "Boomtown is sanctioned by USAV, AVP, and AAU."

### Still owner-dependent (deferred)
- The two league schedule renderers ship with **clearly-labeled SAMPLE rows** until the published **WomensLeagues / MensLeagues** CSV URLs are pasted into each page's `window.__LEAGUE_CSV__` (see HANDOFF).
- Instagram feed embed, self-hosted partner logos, and confirmed men's-page photos are unchanged this release.
